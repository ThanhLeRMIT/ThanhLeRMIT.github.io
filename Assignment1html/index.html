        <h1>THANH LE INTERACTIVE MEDIA A1 - NATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA</h1>

        <img src="./bannerimage.jpg" alt="banner" style = float:right;> 
     
       
  
        <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail</h3>
        <p >Upon initially entering the website I attempted to read the acknowledgement towards the Wuurundjeri Woi-Wurrung people before the home page loaded up. 
            Presented with the large banner detailing the running "The Picasso Century" event I scanned the element and noticed the five menu dots in the bottom right.  Moving my mouse over the dots I began to individually click on each one - cycling through each advertisement.
            After this I began to scroll down the web page using my mousewheel; scanning through the various exhibitions that were listed. I found my eyes drawn towards the "Perspectives on Picasso" section in the
             "Event Highlights" due to the eye grabbing artpiece, and so I speedily scrolled down the rest of the page to see if there was anything I would find more intriguing  before scrolling back up to the tile, moving my mouse over to the "Find out more >" line which I assumed was a link
             and clicking it. Once this new page had loaded I was once again presented with the eye grabbing art piece before looking down and reading the short two line pitch detailing the event. Scrolling down again I looked at the four highlighted artworks that events were being held on
            before reading through the short paragraph detailing "The Picasso Century". I then decided to look for something else that was intriguing and directed my attention towards the navigation bar at the
            top of the website. While I had noticed this bar on opening the website I did not feel compelled to look into at first due to being interested in the banner as well as scrolling down the 
            rest of the homepage. As the "Perspectives on Picasso" page was less densely packed with information I decided to now read through the navigation bar and clicked on "Shop"; as I was curious about what kind of merchandise was being sold.
            Again scrolling down the page as I scanned each individual category of merchandise, I then scrolled back up and moused over the "The Picasso Century Kids" image wondering what items were being directly targeted towards children. Finally I clicked on this image when then loaded up the web page showing the relevant merchandise.

        <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience</h3>
        <p>When first engaging with this experience there were three things I "initially" paid attention to.  Upon clicking the link, the first thing I noticed was the message of <br> acknowledgement, clear white text set against a black background. Upon the 
            loading of the actual homepage the first thing I paid attention to was the large banner <br> advertising main events. However aesthetically the first thing I took note of was the clean black and white color palette.
        </p>

        <h3>What did you spend the most time engaging with</h3>
        <p>The thing I spent the most time engaging with in this website was the large amount of data presented regarding running events, times, merchandise and <br>general information pertaining to the National Gallery.</p>

        <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience</h3>
        <p>The most common action in my two minute interaction was reading/scanning the different tiles/bits of information spread throughout.</p>

        <h3> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience</h3>
        <p>My imppression of this interactive experience is that is meant to be informative. The primary goal is to provide a experience that will communicate <br>relevant information to the user in regards to the National Gallery. Consequently this also acts as a means of advertising through drawing interest/inquiries from the user.  </p>

        <h3> How does the experience communicate it's primary goal</h3>
        <p>The experience communicates it's primary goal by presenting pockets of information on the website under various headings/sections and allowing the user <br> to scan through and engage with each one. </p>

        <h3>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often <br>you are intended to interact with the experience</h3>
        <p>I believe the intended length of the a single interaction is generally quite short but dependant on the intent of the user. A user with no prior knowledge may spend <br>10-20 minutes
            surveying the website in order to find points of interest and/or plan an outing, while a user looking for specific information can be in and out within 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3> What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference</h3>
        <p>On a larger scale the website incites metaphors of an actual gallery, layed out with varying sized tiles of pictures and information that you can choose to further enquire about.<br> This is also accentuated in the way that one scrolls/travels down the home page to observe each of these pieces.
            Next to the navigation bar the website also uses common metaphors<br> such as a globe to signify an option for changing the language as well as a magnifying glass for searching.
        </p>

        <h3>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it</h3>
        <p>This metaphor of a real life gallery is meant to make you feel like you are at the site in person, bridging the gap between the online and offline platform. The use of the globe <br>and magnifying glass are common associations that have been 
            established throughout many websites/ui, which allows the user to quickly understand <br> their functions, making the website feel accessible and understandable.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you</h3>
        <p>The most frustrating element of the interaction was actually the handling of the message of acknowledgement at the beginning. This was because the loading of the home page <br>was auto timed, meaning I could not fully read the message on the first visit as I was not expecting it. This lead me to having to reload the page to properly comprehend<br> what was said.
            Rather then allowing for one to continue through clicking or scrolling this auto timed transition felt unnecessary.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you</h3>
        <p>The most satisfying element of this interaction was the aforementioned layout and gallery metaphor. The way that the information the website was presented in varying sizes <br>and styles of organisation made it feel very dynamic as I was looking through. I enjoyed scrolling through observing each eye catching element/image and the overall experience felt seamless.
